Using Basic Commands of Bullet Physics Library to Design a Controller for a Naturally Unstable Robot

A Reference for PyBullet Physics Library Commands and implementation of a simple example. <br>
<b>GYM Environment + COAX PPO</b> <br>
PID Controller tuned with PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) <br>
The agent was implemented using the PPO example from <a href="https://coax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/stubs/ppo.html">COAX PPO</a>.
